            <p>Programming is the art of instructing computers to perform specific tasks by providing them with a sequence of well-defined instructions. It is the foundation of modern technology and plays a vital role in creating software applications, websites, games, and more. At its core, programming involves writing code in programming languages such as Python, Java, C++, and many others. Learning programming not only empowers individuals to bring their creative ideas to life but also encourages problem-solving skills and logical thinking. </p>

            <p>Data structures and algorithms are fundamental concepts in computer science that enable efficient storage, retrieval, and manipulation of data, as well as the design of optimized processes for solving problems. Data structures are organized formats used to store and organize data, ranging from simple arrays and linked lists to more complex structures like trees, graphs, and hash tables. Algorithms, on the other hand, are step-by-step procedures or instructions that define how data is processed or problems are solved. They can vary in efficiency and effectiveness, with the goal of finding the most optimal solution for a given problem.</p>

            <img src="html2-3.png" alt="Web Development Fundamentals">
            <p>Web development is the practice of creating and maintaining websites on the internet. It encompasses a range of skills and technologies required to build functional and visually appealing web applications. Fundamentals of web development include proficiency in HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for structuring web content, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for designing layouts and visual elements, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to websites. Understanding client-server architecture, HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), and the basics of databases are also crucial for effective web development.</p>
